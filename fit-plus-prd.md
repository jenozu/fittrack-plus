| **Problem Statement**        | Millions of users struggle to maintain consistent healthy habits due to fragmented tools for food logging, workouts, and progress tracking. Current apps like MyFitnessPal lack personalization, habit gamification, and integrated AI-coaching that adapts to the user’s goals. |
| **Product Goal / Objective** | Build a holistic health-tracking ecosystem that merges nutrition, fitness, and habit-building with smart recommendations and cross-device integration — helping users not just log data but stay motivated long-term.                                                            |
| **Target Audience**          | Health-conscious adults aged 18-50 who want to lose weight, gain muscle, or track overall wellness. Sub-segments: casual fitness users, nutrition enthusiasts, athletes, and coaches.                                                                                            |

Would you like me to now:

1. **Generate a companion MVP document** (based on this PRD), or
2. **Turn this PRD into a Notion-ready table** (for easy task tracking and planning)?

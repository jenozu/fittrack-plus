## 🔍 How It Works Now

### Food Search Flow:
```
User searches "greek yogurt"
    ↓
1. Check Internal Database (cached)
    ↓
2. If more results needed:
    → Query Open Food Facts (branded products)
    → Query USDA (generic foods)
    ↓
3. Combine & deduplicate results
    ↓
4. Cache new results locally
    ↓
5. Return to user
```

### Barcode Search Flow:
```
User scans barcode "3017620422003"
    ↓
1. Check Internal Database
    ↓
2. If not found:
    → Query Open Food Facts (excellent barcode database)
    ↓
3. Cache result
    ↓
4. Return product info
```

## 🗑️ Optional Cleanup

You can optionally remove the old Nutritionix service (but it's safe to keep):

```bash
# Optional: Remove Nutritionix service
rm backend/services/nutritionix_service.py
```

The app no longer uses it, so it won't affect anything.
